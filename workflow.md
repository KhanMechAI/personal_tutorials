# How to setup Jupyter Virtual Environment

## Setting up the Virtual Env

Run the following command to launch virtual environment

```bash
source py_36_env/bin/activate
```

`py_36_env` is the name of that specific virtual environment. You can set up others if you need specific versions of packages and depenedencies installed.

## Installing the IPython Kernel

Might not have to run this, or only possibly only need to run this once? Still working on this tutorial.

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=py_36_env
```
